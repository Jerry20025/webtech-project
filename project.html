    <p><u>GEOGRAPHY OF INDIA</u></p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural
        experiences. With a rich
        heritage and
        myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area
        of 32,
        87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As
        the 7th
        largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the
        sea,
        which give the country a distinct geographical entity.</h1>
    <p><u>Nature And Wildlife</u></p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">From hauntingly beautiful snowy escapades to lush forests and hills of rolling green,
        from the endless golden
        beaches to
        the sapphire and emerald lakes embedded in the landscape, the natural beauty of the Indian subcontinent is
        unparalleled.
        The unspoilt and unexplored terrains of the country leave one in awe of their breathtaking splendour. Moreover,
        the
        differences and contrasts of one region from another accentuate the appeal of these landscapes - be it the
        frigid cold
        deserts of Leh that call to the soul-searcher in you or the sun-drenched mystique desert dunes of Rajasthan that
        take
        you back to the times of royals. Starting from the snow-capped Himalayas in the north, traversing the deserts of
        Rajasthan, crossing the lush forests of Madhya Pradesh and then sailing in the expansive backwaters of Kerala,
        and
        finally diving into the pristine waters of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the journey is full of adventurous
        highlands
        and serene plains and lowlands. A land boasting a diverse variety of flora and fauna, India is also home to many
        national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, tiger reserves and biosphere reserves, which offer enchanting wildlife
        sightings.</h1>
    <p><u>SPIRITUAL</u></p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">India is its billion people. And it is safe to say that these people define what
        spirituality in India is. The
        most
        prominent religions in the country are Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. Apart from
        these
        there are several other schools of thoughts. The country is filled with many spiritual destinations which should
        not be
        missed by anyone looking for the true Indian experience. These are open and welcome to everyone.</h1>
